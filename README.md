List of abbreviations:
  * DFT - Density functional theory
  * QC - Quantum chemistry
  * QM - Quantum mechanics
  * MD - Molecular dynamics

## Books and lecture notes

## Working with remote clusters

## Software


### Quantum chemistry



### Molecular dynamics simulations

* Classical simulations
  * Potential is defined as a sum of bond, angle, dihedral, van der Waals, electrostatic terms
    * Parameters from experiments, QC calculations
* No quantum mechanical effects
  * Bond breaking, polarization, ...
* GROMACS

### Visualization

* Avogadro
  *
* Chemcraft - 150 days free license

### Scripting and working with data

* Python
  * Best choice!
  * Rich and modern environment
  * Excellent data science stack, useful libraries:
    * Numpy: linear algebra calculations and much more
    * SciPy: special functions, integrals, a lot of numerical tools
    * Matplotlib: plotting, excellent for visualizations
    * Pandas: "excel", data structures, good for data manipulation, analysis
    * Scikit-learn: Machine learning, regression, statistics
    * Keras, tensorflow: Deep learning, probably not needed yet

  * Jupyter Notebooks
    * Nice graphical user interface

* Bash tools
  * sed
  * awk
  * gnuplot
